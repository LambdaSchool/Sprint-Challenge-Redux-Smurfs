 Your initial/default state for this project could look a lot like this

   addingSmurf: false
   updatingSmurf: false
   deletingSmurfs: false
   error: null
 }

/*
  You'll only need one smurf reducer for this project.
  Feel free to export it as a default and import as rootReducer. 
  This will guard your namespacing issues.
  Components can read your store as, `state` and not `state.fooReducer`.
