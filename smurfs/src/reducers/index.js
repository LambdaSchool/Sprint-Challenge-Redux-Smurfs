/*
  You'll only need one smurf reducer for this project.
  Feel free to export it as a default and import as rootReducer. 
  This will guard your namespacing issues.
  There is no need for 'combineReducers' in this project.
  Components can then read your store as, `state` and not `state.fooReducer`.
