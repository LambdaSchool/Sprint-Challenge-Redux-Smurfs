1.  Name 3 JavaScript Array/Object Methods that do not produce side-effects? Which method do we use to create a new object while extending the properties of another object?
      Array methods --> filter(), concat(), map(), reduce() [This is ok], slice() methods can return new arrays without modifying the original arrays. The spread operator and Object.assign() methods are useful to create a new objects.

2.  Describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
      Actions are Javascript objects that send the data from app to the store. 
      Reducers are pure functions that take actions and previousState as arguments and return modified state based on the user interactions with the app.
      store is the place where application state resides, it is read only and we can change the state through reducers only. It is actual heart of the redux applications.
   
3.  What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
   Application state is the Global state and it can be passed to all the components in the application if required. Where as component state is limited to the component that it resides.

4.  What is middleware?
    middleWare is an efficient interface between actions and reducers which passes data based on what is  required, instead of everything at one time.

5.  Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
    Thunk is an integral part of redux. It uses the functions generated by actions and dispatches the data through functions to the reducers.

6.  Which `react-redux` method links up our `components` with our `redux store`?
      connect method links up our components and redux store
