1.  Describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

-Actions send data from the application to the store, they are also functions that are invoked when passed 'type'. 

-Reducers change state in response to the actions. A store is where the whole state tree of my application lives.

-It is a single source of truth because we only want to retrieve data
from one place for our application.


1.  What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

interact with state.

1.  Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

return functions that have direct access to the dispatch method. It changes the actions to return asynchronously.
