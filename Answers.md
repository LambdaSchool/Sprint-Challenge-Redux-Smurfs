1. Array.map, Array.concat, and Array.reduce are all side-effect free
2. In redux, actions are functions which notify the app about desired changes in state, which are passed to components. Reducers are functions which take the current state and the latest action, and return the state after applying the latest action. The store holds the state and all reducers, and updates the state by dispatching actions to the reducers. 'Single Source of Truth' refers to the fact that all app state is contained in the redux store, and can only be modified by actions sent to reducers.
3. Application state is data that concerns the entire application, such as the latest server response or the currently selected data object. This state is provided by the React context or the library. Component state concerns presentation-level data, such as the value of an input or state of a toggled component. This state is handled with react's component state functions, because the rest of the app does not need access to it.
4. Middleware is a function whose purpose is to operate on a request before sending it further. Middleware can be applied to many libraries with objects that are modeled as 'connections' to a data source, and allow custom logic in response to certain events.
5. 'Redux-thunk' is a middleware for the actions dispatch pipeline. It allows us to create actions which have access to the Redux store's `dispatch` function. This lets an action dispatch multiple action types, making sense of asynchronous requests by dispatching an action for each stage of the request.
6. `connect` is the function which is used to wrap components for use with Redux
7. I changed the implementation of DELETE on the server so that it responds with the list of remaining smurfs.
