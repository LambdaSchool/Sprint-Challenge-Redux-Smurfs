1.  Name 3 JavaScript Array/Object Methods that do not produce side-effects? Which method do we use to create a new object while extending the properties of another object?
    > Filter, Map, and Concat. Object.assign({}, {newKey: newValue}). For both arrays and objects, the spread operator works. {...object, newKey: newValue} or [...values, newValue]. The spread operator even creates a copy if you want it to. Like slice. newArr = [...oldArr]
1.  Describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
    > The store is where the entire state of your application lives. It's has a few basic methods, and can be initialized simply with middleware. The store is an immutable object. If you want to change the store, you must dispatch an action to it. An action describes how the store must change, and then gives the payload (if required) in order to make that change. This is just an object. The action and the current state are funnelled into a reducer. The reducer looks at the 'type' then returns a new copy of the state object to put into the store based on the specified type.
1.  What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
    > Application state is the entire state of your application. This state can be accessed by any component by the connect function. Component state is the state of your class based components. You should probably use Application level state for things that require universal access. Like logging in a user, creating a shopping cart, and even controllable AJAX requests. If you notice that you're drilling props down into like 6 or 7 components, you should probably be using Application state. If you feel like all you're doing is rendering some UI, then you might want to use component state.
1.  What is middleware?
    > middleware is a piece of software that we right that is injected inside of our store. It basically goes between our store and it's dispatch. It has access to the store at all levels, and gives us the ability to dispatch actions and return the results. redux-logger works by console logging the state and action before, then after, the action is executed. You could create a middleware to do anything. Even something as simple as creating an alert if the action type is an error.
1.  Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
    > redux thunk allows us to return a function inside of our action creators. Typically, our action creators return an object, and that object is an action. But thunk allows us to run asynchronous actions by letting us jump inside of this return function. This also allows us to dispatch multiple actions inside of our action creator
1.  Which `react-redux` method links up our `components` with our `redux store`?
    > connect({ state object }, { action creators object })(MyComponent) - this is a curried function. Which means that the connect function is executed, and RESULTS of the connect function are then called on the MyComponent function.
