1.  Name 3 JavaScript Array/Object Methods that do not produce side-effects? Which method do we use to create a new object while extending the properties of another object?
    .map, .filter, .concat / The Spread Operator 1. Describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? actions: They are payloads of information. They data from applications to the store. reducers: They speicify how state's change. In response to the action's sent to the store. store: is an object that combines actions and reducers. The store holds applications, allows state do be updated, and it registers listners. Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application? because it can control components 1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? Component State is local and mutable while Application State is global and immutable When would be a good time to use one over the other? Application State is good for modifying the store object.Components are good for interactive applications. 1. What is middleware? Middleware provides a way to interact with actions that have been dispatched to the store before they reach the store's reducer. Examples of different uses for middleware include logging actions, reporting errors, making asynchronous requests, and dispatching new actions. 1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? It provides the ability to have our action creators return functions that have direct access to the dispatch() method of the Redux Store. How does it change our `action-creators`? dispatch multiple actions (or none at all) from a single action creator. It provides the ability to have our action creators return functions that have direct access to the dispatch() method of the Redux Store. 1. Which `react-redux` method links up our `components` with our `redux store`? connect
