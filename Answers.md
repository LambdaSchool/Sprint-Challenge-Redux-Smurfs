# 1) concat, map, filter, reduce
# 2) Store - holds the state, Actions - functions dispatched by store to the reducer, Reducer - takes state and action as parameters and returns an altered state (immutable)
# 3) Application state is in the store, component state is in the React component. Component data is for constantly changing data (temp)
# 4) modules/libraries that provide an extension point between dispatching an action and the time it reaches the reducer
# 5) Used for async actions, which allows you to write actions that return functions instead of actions
# 6) connect
