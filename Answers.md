### Actions are payloads of information that send data from application to redux store. They are the only source of information for the store. 
### Reducers specify how the state changes in response to actions sent to the store. All application state is stored in one object.
### Store brings actions and reducers together. Only one single store for a whole redux application. It's known as a 'single source of truth' because the app doesn't work without it and anything not connected correctly will break the app.

# Question 3
